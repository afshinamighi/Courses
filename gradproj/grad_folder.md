# Graduation Folder

This document provides an overview of possible items that students **may include** in their graduation folder. It is not intended to be a strict checklist, but rather a guideline to help students reflect on what evidence they can prepare to best demonstrate their work, growth, and competencies during the graduation project.

The content is a work in progress and will continue to evolve based on feedback from students and colleagues.

## Graduation Folder Structure:

## Advice

All the content of the report must clearly justify the choices and proposals: it must provide clear answers to the questions of "WHY?" with reliable references, experiments, research.

- advice regarding current solution
  - alternatives, pros and cons of each solution, selction criteria
  - risk analysis and cost analysis 

- advice regarding future of the project
  - proposals for the new features
  - proposals for the future technologies
  - proposals for future modifications/improvements/etc
