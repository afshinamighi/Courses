# Write a program that converts a binary (base 2) number to decimal (base 10).
# Your program should begin by reading the binary number from the user as a string.
# Then it should compute the equivalent decimal number by processing
# each digit in the binary number.
# Finally, your program should display the equivalent decimal number
# with an appropriate message.
