# Write a program that draws “modular rectangles” like the ones below.
# The user specifies the width and height of the rectangle, and the entries start at 0
# and increase typewriter fashion from left to right and top to bottom, but are all done mod 10.
# Example: Below are examples of a 3 x 5
# 0 1 2 3 4
# 5 6 7 8 9
# 0 1 2 3 4
