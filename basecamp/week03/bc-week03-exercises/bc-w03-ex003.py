# A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward.
# For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words.
# Write a program that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to determines whether or not it is a
# palindrome. Display the result, including a meaningful output message.
