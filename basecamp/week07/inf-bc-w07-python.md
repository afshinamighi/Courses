# Python 07: Functions and Collective Structures.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning activities for Python 07. In Python 07, you will learn more in depth about tuples, lists, dictionaris and functions. 

**Note:** Exercises of this learning path must be done using:

1. IDE: Using **BRef-01: Chapter 19, Section: Integrated Development Environment** PyCharm can be installed in your local machine.


## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:
Python
- **BRef-01**: Book, Bill Lubanovic; "Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages"; [Available here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/) 
- **ORef-01**: Online Tutorial; Charles Severance; "Python for Everybody"; [Available here](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html)


## Path:

### Step-01: Functions (more).

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python functions: anonymous functions.
	2. understand the concepts of namespace and scope in Python programs.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 09** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. "Functions are first-class citizens": What does this sentence mean?
   2. What is an anonymous function and how can you define it in Python? Experiment with some examples.
   3. What are *namespace* and *scope*? What is the scope of a function? Use examples to justify your answers. 

#### Exercises:


1. Complete the function that checks if the items in a given list are `True` for the given lambda. Return a list containing all `True` values.

```python
def check_with_lambda(l, lam):
    #write the code

x = lambda a : a < 10
y = [1,6,19,22,7]
print(check_with_lambda(x, y)) #[1,6,7]
x = lambda a : a.index(1) == 'b'
y = ["abc", "bcd", "ube", "cur"]
print(check_with_lambda(x, y)) #["abc","ube"]
```

2. Often implementing your solutions you may need to use some important built-in functions: ```map(...)``` and ```filter(...)```. Study them first [here](https://www.brianheinold.net/python/python_book.html#section_map_filter_reduce) and practice a few small examples to understand how they work and when you might need them.

3. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.

### Step-02: Tuples and Lists (more).

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python Tuples and Lists: join(), list(), copy(), deepcopy(), slicing and list comprehension.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 07** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. We have learned *join()* on a string. How does *join()* work in a list?
   2. How can we sort items of a list? Is this possible on a tuple?
   3. There are several ways to copy a list: *list(), slicing, copy()* and *deepcopy()*. Experiment different expamples for each technique.
   4. How can one build a list using *list comprehension*? Do we have *tuple comprehension*?

#### Exercises:

1. The method `list.sort()` sorts a list ascending. Look up how to sort descending and try it. 

2. Create a list containing at least three `tuples` containing some numbers. Print the last item of each tuple by looping through the list. 

3. Complete the function that returns a list containing all the values from all tuples in the given list.  

```python
def create_list_from_tuples(a):
    #write the code

l = [(1,5,4),(1,2),(8,5,19,0)]
print(create_list_from_tuples(l))
#[1,5,4,1,2,8,5,19,0]
```

4. Take the list of tuples from the previous exercise. Sort the list descending on the last item of each tuple.

5. Create a loop that creates a list containing tuples with the numbers 1 to 10 in pairs of 2. The result should be `[(1,2),(3,4),(5,6),(7,8),(9,10)]`.

6. Take the list from the previous exercise. Remove the tuples in which the first item is an odd number. Use a lambda to determine this. 

7. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.

### Step-03: Dictionaries and Sets (more).

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. interpret and implement Python programs with Python Dictionaries and Sets: copy(), deepcopy(), dictionary comprehension, nested structures.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 08** answer and experiment the following questions:
   1. How do *copy()* and *deepcopy()* behave on dictionaries? What about sets?
   2. How does *dictionary comprehension* work? What about sets?
   3. Try to build the following nested structures:
	   - List of lists.
	   - Tuple of lists.
	   - Tuple of tuples.
	   - List of tuples 

#### Exercises:

1. Complete the function to merge two lists into one dictionary.

```python
def merge_lists_into_dictionary(l1, l2):
    #write the code

keys = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
values = ['#FF0000','#008000', '#0000FF']
result = merge_lists_into_dictionary(keys, values)
print(result) #{'red': '#FF0000', 'green': '#008000', 'blue': '#0000FF'}
```

2. Given is a list of dictionaries. Sadly the values are the wrong way around. The first value should be at the last key, second value at the second from last key, and so on. Create a function that switches these values for each list you could give it. 

```python
def swith_the_values(l):
    #Write the code

x = [{'Math':81}, {'Physics':83}, {'Chemistry':87}, {'English': 42}]
print(swith_the_values(x))
#[{'Math':42, 'Physics':87, 'Chemistry':83}, {'English': 81}]
x = [{'a':'b'}, {'c':'d'}]
print(swith_the_values(x))
#[{'a':'d'}, {'c':'b'}]
```

3. Given is a dictionary with tuples. Complete to code to add all keys, at which the second Tuple value is Pass, to a list and return that list

```python
def create_pass_list(l):
    #Write the code

x = {'Math':(81,"Pass"), 'Physics':(50,"Fail"), 'Chemistry':(90,"Pass"), 'English': (42,"Fail")}
print(create_pass_list(x))
#["Math", "Chemistry"]
```

4. Based on the previous exercise. Write a new function that creates a list with failed subjects. Merge the two lists into a new dictionary with the correct keys. Result should be: `{'Pass':["Math", "Chemistry"], 'Fail':["Physics","English"]}`.

5. Write a function that takes the dictionary from the previous exercise and turns each value into his own key:value pair. Sort the dictionary by the key. The result should be: `{'English':"Fail", 'Chemistry': "Pass", 'Physics': "Fail", 'Math':"Pass"} `;

6. Test all the functions from the last few exercises if they still work given a different starting dictionary. If not, try to explain what went wrond and fix it. 
A different dictionary could be:
`{'Soccer':(9, "Pass"), 'Snowboarding':(3, "Fail"), 'Tennis':(7, "Pass")}`.

7. Design two exercises of your own. They should improve understanding topics of this step.

## Problems:

*Note:* The following functions are implemented to to read the content of a given file (text or csv) and return a list of lines within the file. Use these functions in your solutions.

```python
def load_txt_file(file_name):
    try:
        with open(file_name , 'r') as file_obj:
            file_content = file_obj.readlines()
    except:
        print('Exception in opening file:',file_name)
    finally:
    	  file_obj.close()
    return file_content
```

```python
import csv

def load_csv_file(file_name):
    file_content = []
    try:
        with open(file_name , 'r') as csv_file_object:
            csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file_object)
            for row in csv_reader:
                file_content.append(row)
    except:
        print('Exception in opening file:',file_name)
    finally:
        csv_file_object.close()
    return file_content
```

1. A data file containing average daily tempreture of Amsterdam is [available here](https://academic.udayton.edu/kissock/http/Weather/gsod95-current/NLAMSTDM.txt). The first column is the month number, the second is the day number, the third is the year and fourth column is the weather tempretaure in Farenheit. Download the file and implement your solution to meet the following requirements:
	- The program gets the file name as a program argument.
	- Use the function ```load_txt_file``` to load the content of the file in a list.
	- Clean the content of the loaded list. Like: remove new line character, split each line.
	-  Process the data and calculate the average temprature per year. Make a list of tuples ```(year, average temprature)``` and print the list.
	-  Make a new list of tuples where the average temprature of each year is in Celcius. *Hint*: Use built-in ```map()``` function.
	-  Which year was the warmest (or coldest) year? Use average temprature.
	-  Construct a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is the year and the second element of the tuple is a dictionary with months as the keys and average temprature (F or C) of each month as the value. Which year has the warmest (or coldest) January? Which year has the coldest (or warmest) March?
	-  Propose one analysis that you would like to apply on this data set and implement your solution.

2. A data file containing Netflix title is [available here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). A copy of the data set is provided [here](./problems_data/netflix_titles.csv). Implement your solution in a program that meets the following requirements:
	- The program gets the file name as a program argument.
	- Use the function ```load_csv_file``` to load the content of the file in a list.
	- The first line of the file specifies the name of each column. For example, the first column is ```show_id```, the second is the ```type``` of the show, the third is the ```title``` of the show, etc. Print this line and explore the kind of information you can extract.
	- Make two separate lists of show types: TV Show and Movies. Print the lists. Which one do we have more, tv shows or movies?
	- There are some directors who lead both movies and tv shows. For example, search the name ```David Ayer```. He is the director of three movies and one tv show. Print the (full) names of directors who lead both tv shows and movies.
	- Print the name of each director, the number of movies (s)he was the director of, the number of tv shows (s)he was the director of. You can construct a list of tuples like ```(director name, number of movies, number of tv shows)``` and print it. 
	- Propose two analysis that you would like to apply on this data set and implement your solution.


## Assignment:

Create a progam that can convert a name/string to the hashed representation of that value. The program that needs to be implemented for this assignment is described below.

- Create a function that given the input string converts it to the encoded/decoded equivalent based on the provided or already set key/hashmap
- Make sure to only convert values that are in the key/hashmap, if the value is not present, use its own value

	- `encode_string(data: str, key: str = None) -> str`
	- `decode_string(data: str, key: str = None) -> str`

- Create a function that given a list of inputs converts the complete list to the encoded/decoded equivalent based on the key/hashmap.
- You can use the already created encode/decode function when looping through the list. *Hint:* make use of the `map` function within python with a lambda to call the internal function with all elements [element, key]
- as a return value, you should return a list with the converted values
	- `encode_list(data: list, key: str = None) -> list`
	- `decode_list(data: list, key: str = None) -> list`


- Create a function that given a encoded value, decoded value and a key/hashmap (optional) checks if the values are correct
- the return value should be a boolean value (`True` if values match, `False` if they don't match)
	- `validate_values(encoded: str, decoded: str, key: str = None) -> bool`

- Create a function that given a key, converts to a key_hashmap (Dict) to be used for converting
	- each oneven character is the Key of the Dict, each even character is the coresponding Value
	- you should validate if the given input is an even input, otherwise show the error: Invalid hashvalue input
	- example: `a@b.c>d#eA` will become: `{'a': '@', 'b': '.', 'c': '>', 'd', '#', 'e': 'A'}`
	- `set_hashmap(conversion_string: str) -> None`

Main program [main():]

- Ask for key to use for convertion (make sure to validate against even string length).

- Build menu structure as following (the input can be case-insensitive (so E and e are valid inputs)).

	- [E] Encode value to hashed value
	- [D] Decode hashed value to normal value
	- [P] Print all encoded/decoded values
	- [V] Validate 2 values against eachother
	- [Q] Quit program

- For ease of use, you can use the following string as a default key to use within your program:

```python 
key = `a_b?c9d6e1f4g!h:i<j|k{l0m@n7o+p~q2r+s/t=u^v3w]x(y-z>A*B8C;D%E#F}G5H)I[J$` 
```

*Hints*: 

- To test your functions, use the provided unit test provided in **/week07/assignment_data/namehasher_test.py** and complete the test functions with your own code.
- A template for your solution is provided in **/week07/assignment_data/namehasher.py**.
