    "**Motivation:** Assume we have data of the weather statistics for the last 200 years. Analysing the data we find out that *on average* in July and in a certain city the weather is rainy for 5 days out of 31 days. Suppose there is not much change in the climate. What would be the probability of having a rainy day on 10th of July in the coming year?\n",
    "In this case, we use the past relative frequency of certain event (rainy days) to predict the event in the future. We achive this by using statistical data from a certain events to assign a *numerical value* to the probability of events. Basically, we are emplying [the empirical law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). \n",

The relative frequency of the event $A$ in $n$ repetitions of the experiment is defined as $f_n(A)=n(A)/n$, where $n(A)$ is the number of times that event $A$ occurred in the $n$ repetitions of the experiment. The relative frequency is a number between 0 and 1 (why?).\n",

If $S$ is a finite sample space containing all outcomes with equal likelihood and $E$ is an event in $S$, then probability of $E$ will be: $P(E) = |E| / |S|$\n",
