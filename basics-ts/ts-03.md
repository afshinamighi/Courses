## Collective Structures

In the following, the basics of collective data structures in TypeScript, including arrays, lists, sets, dictionaries (objects), and tuples will be introduced. They provide different ways to store and manipulate collections of data:

- Arrays:
Arrays are used to store collections of elements of the same type. In TypeScript, you can define an array using square brackets ([]) and specify the 
type of the elements within the array. Here's an example:

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

- Lists:
Lists are similar to arrays and are used to store collections of elements. In TypeScript, you can use the Array type and specify the element type 
within angle brackets (<>). Here's an example:

```typescript
let names: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
```

- Sets:
Sets are used to store unique values of any type. In TypeScript, you can define a set using the Set class. Here's an example:

```typescript
let uniqueNumbers: Set<number> = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

- Dictionaries (Objects):
Dictionaries, also known as objects, are used to store key-value pairs. In TypeScript, you can define an object using curly braces ({}) and specify 
the key and value types. Here's an example:

```typescript
let person: { name: string, age: number } = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
```

- Tuples:
Tuples are used to represent an array with a fixed number of elements of different types. In TypeScript, you can define a tuple using square brackets 
([]) and specifying the types of each element in order. Here's an example:

```typescript
let employee: [string, number, boolean] = ["Alice", 30, true];
```

- Operations:
To access elements in arrays, lists, or tuples, you can use the index of the element enclosed in square brackets. For example:

```typescript
console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
console.log(names[1]); // Output: "Bob"
console.log(employee[2]); // Output: true
```

To iterate over elements in arrays, lists, sets, or tuples, you can use loops such as for...of or array methods like forEach. Here's an example using 
forEach:

```typescript
names.forEach((name: string) => {
  console.log(name);
});
```

You can add or remove elements in arrays, lists, sets, or objects using various methods provided by TypeScript. For example:

```typescript
numbers.push(6); // Add an element to the end of the array
uniqueNumbers.delete(3); // Remove an element from the set
delete person.age; // Remove a property from the object
```
