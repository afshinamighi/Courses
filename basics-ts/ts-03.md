## Handling Events

### Events

In general, an event is an action or occurrence that happens within a system or program. Events can be triggered by various user interactions or system actions, such as clicking a button, pressing a key, submitting a form, or receiving data from an external source. Events provide a way for programs to respond to user input or system changes dynamically.

Programming in TypeScript connected to an HTML form, events play a crucial role in creating interactive and responsive web applications. TypeScript allows you to handle events seamlessly by providing *event-driven* programming capabilities.

When working with HTML forms in TypeScript, events are used to capture and respond to user interactions with form elements, such as buttons, input fields, checkboxes, dropdowns, and more. Some common events associated with HTML form elements include:

- `click`: Triggered when a user clicks on an element, such as a button.
- `change`: Triggered when the value of an input element or select dropdown changes.
- `input`: Triggered when the user enters or modifies the text in an input field.
- `submit`: Triggered when the user submits a form by clicking a submit button or pressing Enter.

### Event Listeners

By attaching event listeners to form elements using TypeScript, you can define custom callback functions that execute when the corresponding events occur. These callback functions allow you to respond to user actions, validate form inputs, perform calculations, update the UI, or interact with external APIs.

The event listeners in TypeScript are implemented using the `addEventListener` method. This method takes two parameters: the *event type* and the *callback function*. The callback function contains the logic that will be executed when the event is triggered.

With event handling in TypeScript, you can create dynamic and interactive forms that respond to user input in real-time, providing a more engaging user experience.

When the event of one object influences other object(s) in a form, there are a few general steps you can follow in TypeScript:

- Identify the objects: Determine which object(s) in your form are affected by the event of another object. This could be checkboxes, input fields, 
buttons, or any other interactive elements.

- Attach event listeners: Use the `addEventListener` method to attach event listeners to the object(s) that trigger the event. Specify the event type (e.g., `click`, `change`, `input`) and define a callback function that will be executed when the event occurs.

- Handle the event: In the event listener's callback function, write the code that will be executed when the event is triggered. This code should include the desired actions or updates that need to be performed on the affected object(s) or their associated data.

- Access the affected object(s): Use JavaScript DOM methods (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.) to access the affected object(s) by their unique IDs or other selectors. Assign them to variables to easily manipulate their properties or values.

- Perform actions on affected object(s): Inside the event listener's callback function, write the code that performs the desired actions or updates on the affected object(s). This could involve modifying their properties, updating their values, showing or hiding elements, or triggering other related events.

By following these steps, you can create interactive behavior where events on one object influence the state or behavior of other object(s) in your form.

Remember, the specific implementation details will depend on your specific use case and the elements involved. You can adapt the concepts and techniques based on the requirements of your project.

Here is an example where the event of one checkbox influences the state of another checkbox.

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="checkbox1">
<label for="checkbox1">Checkbox 1</label>
<br>
<input type="checkbox" id="checkbox2">
<label for="checkbox2">Checkbox 2</label>
```


```typescript
const checkbox1 = document.getElementById('checkbox1') as HTMLInputElement;
const checkbox2 = document.getElementById('checkbox2') as HTMLInputElement;

checkbox1.addEventListener('change', function() {
  if (this.checked) {
    checkbox2.checked = false;
    checkbox2.disabled = true;
  } else {
    checkbox2.disabled = false;
  }
});
```

In this example, we have two checkboxes: `checkbox1` and `checkbox2`. When `checkbox1` is checked, we want to uncheck `checkbox2` and disable it. When `checkbox1` is unchecked, we want to re-enable `checkbox2`.

Inside the event listener for `checkbox1`, we check the checked property to determine whether `checkbox1` is checked or unchecked. If it is checked, we set `checkbox2.checked` to `false` to uncheck `checkbox2`, and we set `checkbox2.disabled` to true to disable it. If `checkbox1` is unchecked, we set `checkbox2.disabled` back to `false` to re-enable `checkbox2`.

This way, when the user interacts with `checkbox1`, it will influence the state of `checkbox2` based on whether it is checked or unchecked.

Here's another example where pressing a button triggers a message warning if an input field is empty:

```html
<input type="text" id="myInput">
<button id="submitButton">Submit</button>
<p id="message"></p>
```

```typescript
const input = document.getElementById('myInput') as HTMLInputElement;
const submitButton = document.getElementById('submitButton');
const messageElement = document.getElementById('message');

submitButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
  if (input.value === '') {
    messageElement.textContent = 'Please enter a value in the input field.';
    messageElement.classList.add('warning');
  } else {
    messageElement.textContent = 'Form submitted successfully!';
    messageElement.classList.remove('warning');
  }
});
```

In this example, we have an input field (`myInput`), a submit button (`submitButton`), and a message element (`message`) that will display a warning if the input field is empty.

Inside the event listener for the submit button, we check if the `input.value` is an empty string. If it is, we set the message text to "Please enter a value in the input field" and add the CSS class `warning` to the message element using `classList.add()`. The CSS class warning is defined in the CSS file with the desired styling for the warning message.

If the input field is not empty, we set the message text to `"Form submitted successfully!"` and remove the `warning` class from the message element using `classList.remove()`.

By adding and removing the CSS class `warning`, you can apply specific styling to the warning message, such as changing its color or font weight.

### Problems

1. You are asked to create a length conversion tool using checkboxes and a button. The tool should allow users to convert between centimeters and inches based on their selection.

The interface of the tool consists of the following elements:

- Two checkboxes: representing the unit options for conversion.
- An output box: which displays the result of the conversion.
- A convert button: which triggers the conversion process.

The tool should have the following functionalities:

- When the page loads, the Centimeters checkbox should be initially checked and the other should be disabled.
- At each moment only one of the checkboxes can be checked and enabled. The other one must be unchecked and disabled.
- When the user clicks the convert button, the tool should perform the conversion based on the selected unit and the input value.
- It is assumed that the input value is a valid number and the output is rounded to two decimal places.
