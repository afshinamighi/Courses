## Basics:

Variables in TypeScript can be declared using the let or const keywords. Here's an example:

```typescript
let name: string = "Alice";
const age: number = 30;
```
Basic Calculations:
You can perform basic calculations in TypeScript using arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`. Here's an example:

```typescript
let x: number = 10;
let y: number = 5;
let sum: number = x + y;
let product: number = x * y;
```

To take input from the user, you can use the prompt method or create a basic input form in a web application. Here's an example of using prompt and 
printing the result:

```typescript
let name: string = prompt("Enter your name:");
console.log("Hello, " + name);
```
Conditional Statements:
You can use conditional statements like if, else if, and else to make decisions based on conditions. Here's an example:

```typescript
let age: number = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```
You can use a for loop to iterate over a range of values. Here's an example:

```typescript
for (let i: number = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
A while loop executes as long as a certain condition remains true. Here's an example:

```typescript
let count: number = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```

Putting it all together, here's a complete TypeScript program that takes user input, performs a calculation, and includes both a for loop and a while loop:

```typescript
let x: number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));
let y: number = 5;
let sum: number = x + y;
console.log("The sum is: " + sum);

for (let i: number = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("For loop iteration: " + i);
}

let count: number = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log("While loop iteration: " + count);
  count++;
}
```

When you run this program and provide input, it will calculate the sum of the input number and 5, print the result, and then execute both the for loop 
and the while loop.
