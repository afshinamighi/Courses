## Basics of TS:


**Note**: If you are not familiar of running TS programs locally on your machine, it is recommended to use an online environment (like: [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/PTAEHUFMBsGMHsC2lQBd5oBYoCoE8AHSAZVgCcBLA1UABWgEM8BzM+AVwDsATAGiwoBnUENANQAd0gAjQRVSQAUCEmYKsTKGYUAbpGF4OY0BoadYKdJMoL+gzAzIoz3UNEiPOofEVKVqAHSKymAAmkYI7NCuqGqcANag8ABmIjQUXrFOKBJMggBcISGgoAC0oACCbvCwDKgU8JkY7p7ehCTkVDQS2E6gnPCxGcwmZqDSTgzxxWWVoASMFmgYkAAeRJTInN3ymj4d-jSCeNsMq-wuoPaOltigAKoASgAywhK7SbGQZIIz5VWCFzSeCrZagNYbChbHaxUDcCjJZLfSDbExIAgUdxkUBIursJzCFJtXydajBBCcQQ0MwAUVWDEQC0gADVHBQGNJ3KAALygABEAAkYNAMOB4GRonzFBTBPB3AERcwABS0+mM9ysygc9wASmCKhwzQ8ZC8iHFzmB7BoXzcZmY7AYzEg-Fg0HUiQ58D0Ii8fLpDKZgj5SWxfPADlQAHJhAA5SASPlBFQAeS+ZHegmdWkgR1QjgUrmkeFATjNOmGWH0KAQiGhwkuNok4uiIgMHGxCyYrA4PCCJSAA)) for this tutorial.
 
### Basic Calculations:

Variables in TypeScript can be declared using the let or const keywords. Here's an example:

```typescript
let name: string = "Alice";
const age: number = 30;
```

You can perform basic calculations in TypeScript using arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`. Here's an example:

```typescript
let x: number = 10;
let y: number = 5;
let sum: number = x + y;
let product: number = x * y;
```

To take input from the user, you can use the prompt method or create a basic input form in a web application. Here's an example of using prompt and 
printing the result:

```typescript
let name: string = prompt("Enter your name:");
console.log("Hello, " + name);
```

### Conditional and Iterations:

You can use conditional statements like if, else if, and else to make decisions based on conditions. Here's an example:

```typescript
let age: number = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```
You can use a for loop to iterate over a range of values. Here's an example:

```typescript
for (let i: number = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
A while loop executes as long as a certain condition remains true. Here's an example:

```typescript
let count: number = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```

Putting it all together, here's a complete TypeScript program that takes user input, performs a calculation, and includes both a for loop and a while loop:

```typescript
let x: number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));
let y: number = 5;
let sum: number = x + y;
console.log("The sum is: " + sum);

for (let i: number = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("For loop iteration: " + i);
}

let count: number = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log("While loop iteration: " + count);
  count++;
}
```

When you run this program and provide input, it will calculate the sum of the input number and 5, print the result, and then execute both the for loop and the while loop.

### Functions:

In TypeScript, you can define functions using the function keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. Here's an example of a function that 
adds two numbers and returns the result:

```typescript
function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

Functions in TypeScript can have a return type specified using a colon (:) followed by the desired type. In the above example, the function addNumbers 
has a return type of number. The return keyword is used to specify the value to be returned from the function.

You can define function arguments by listing them within the parentheses after the function name. Each argument is specified with a name followed by a 
colon (:) and the type. In the example above, the function addNumbers takes two arguments, a and b, both of type number.

To call a function, you simply use the function name followed by parentheses. You can pass values as arguments to the function. Here's an example of 
calling the addNumbers function and storing the result in a variable:

```typescript
let result: number = addNumbers(3, 5);
console.log(result); // Output: 8
```

You can also call functions without capturing the return value if you don't need it:

```typescript
addNumbers(2, 4); // Function call without capturing the return value
```

In TypeScript, functions are also considered as first-class citizens, which means you can assign functions to variables or use them as arguments or 
return types of other functions. Here's an example:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): void {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

let greetingFunc: (name: string) => void = greet;
greetingFunc("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice
```

In this example, the greet function is assigned to a variable greetingFunc, which has a function type (name: string) => void. The function type 
specifies the expected argument type and return type of the assigned function.

In TypeScript, you can define optional parameters by appending a question mark (?) after the parameter name. You can also provide default values to 
parameters using the assignment operator (=). Here's an example:

```typescript
function greetUser(name: string, age?: number): void {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
  if (age) {
    console.log("You are " + age + " years old.");
  }
}

greetUser("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
greetUser("Bob", 30); // Output: Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.
```

In the greetUser function, the age parameter is optional. If it's provided, the function includes an additional console log statement.

### Collective Structures

In the following, the basics of collective data structures in TypeScript, including arrays, lists, sets, dictionaries (objects), and tuples will be introduced. They provide different ways to store and manipulate collections of data:

#### Arrays:
Arrays are used to store collections of elements of the same type. In TypeScript, you can define an array using square brackets ([]) and specify the 
type of the elements within the array. Here's an example:

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

#### Lists:
Lists are similar to arrays and are used to store collections of elements. In TypeScript, you can use the Array type and specify the element type 
within angle brackets (<>). Here's an example:

```typescript
let names: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
```

#### Sets:
Sets are used to store unique values of any type. In TypeScript, you can define a set using the Set class. Here's an example:

```typescript
let uniqueNumbers: Set<number> = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

#### Dictionaries (Objects):
Dictionaries, also known as objects, are used to store key-value pairs. In TypeScript, you can define an object using curly braces ({}) and specify 
the key and value types. Here's an example:

```typescript
let person: { name: string, age: number } = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
```

#### Tuples:
Tuples are used to represent an array with a fixed number of elements of different types. In TypeScript, you can define a tuple using square brackets 
([]) and specifying the types of each element in order. Here's an example:

```typescript
let employee: [string, number, boolean] = ["Alice", 30, true];
```

#### Operations:
To access elements in arrays, lists, or tuples, you can use the index of the element enclosed in square brackets. For example:

```typescript
console.log(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
console.log(names[1]); // Output: "Bob"
console.log(employee[2]); // Output: true
```

To iterate over elements in arrays, lists, sets, or tuples, you can use loops such as for...of or array methods like forEach. Here's an example using 
forEach:

```typescript
names.forEach((name: string) => {
  console.log(name);
});
```

You can add or remove elements in arrays, lists, sets, or objects using various methods provided by TypeScript. For example:

```typescript
numbers.push(6); // Add an element to the end of the array
uniqueNumbers.delete(3); // Remove an element from the set
delete person.age; // Remove a property from the object
```

### Classes and Objects

In TypeScript, classes are used as blueprints to create objects. A class defines the structure and behavior of an object, while an object is an 
instance of a class. Here's an example of a Person class and creating an object from it:

```typescript
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

let person1: Person = new Person("Alice", 25);
console.log(person1.name); // Output: "Alice"
console.log(person1.age); // Output: 25
```

Attributes, also known as properties or fields, are variables defined within a class to store data. In the example above, name and age are attributes 
of the Person class.

Methods are functions defined within a class to perform actions or provide behavior. Here's an example of adding a method greet to the Person class:

```typescript
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet(): void {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  }
}

let person1: Person = new Person("Alice", 25);
person1.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

#### Association of Classes:
Classes can be associated with each other by having attributes or methods that refer to instances of other classes. Here's an example of an association between Person and Car classes:

```typescript
class Car {
  brand: string;

  constructor(brand: string) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }

  start(): void {
    console.log("Starting the " + this.brand + " car");
  }
}

class Person {
  name: string;
  car: Car;

  constructor(name: string, car: Car) {
    this.name = name;
    this.car = car;
  }

  drive(): void {
    console.log(this.name + " is driving the " + this.car.brand + " car");
    this.car.start();
  }
}

let car1: Car = new Car("Toyota");
let person1: Person = new Person("Alice", car1);
person1.drive();
```

In this example, the Person class has an attribute car of type Car, representing the car owned by the person. The drive method in the Person class utilizes the Car object and calls its start method.

#### Inheritance:

In TypeScript, classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes using inheritance. The extends keyword is used to inherit from a base 
class. Here's an example of inheritance:

```typescript
class Animal {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;

  constructor(name: string, breed: string) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("The dog barks");
  }
}

let dog1: Dog = new Dog("Max", "Labrador");
console.log(dog1.name); // Output: "Max"
console.log(dog1.breed); // Output: "Labrador"
dog1.makeSound(); // Output: "The
```
