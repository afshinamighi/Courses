## Classes and Objects

In TypeScript, classes are used as blueprints to create objects. A class defines the structure and behavior of an object, while an object is an 
instance of a class. Here's an example of a Person class and creating an object from it:

```typescript
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

let person1: Person = new Person("Alice", 25);
console.log(person1.name); // Output: "Alice"
console.log(person1.age); // Output: 25
```

Attributes:
Attributes, also known as properties or fields, are variables defined within a class to store data. In the example above, name and age are attributes 
of the Person class.

Methods:
Methods are functions defined within a class to perform actions or provide behavior. Here's an example of adding a method greet to the Person class:

```typescript
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet(): void {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  }
}

let person1: Person = new Person("Alice", 25);
person1.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

### Association of Classes:
Classes can be associated with each other by having attributes or methods that refer to instances of other classes. Here's an example of an association between Person and Car classes:

```typescript
class Car {
  brand: string;

  constructor(brand: string) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }

  start(): void {
    console.log("Starting the " + this.brand + " car");
  }
}

class Person {
  name: string;
  car: Car;

  constructor(name: string, car: Car) {
    this.name = name;
    this.car = car;
  }

  drive(): void {
    console.log(this.name + " is driving the " + this.car.brand + " car");
    this.car.start();
  }
}

let car1: Car = new Car("Toyota");
let person1: Person = new Person("Alice", car1);
person1.drive();
```

In this example, the Person class has an attribute car of type Car, representing the car owned by the person. The drive method in the Person class utilizes the Car object and calls its start method.

### Inheritance:

In TypeScript, classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes using inheritance. The extends keyword is used to inherit from a base 
class. Here's an example of inheritance:

```typescript
class Animal {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;

  constructor(name: string, breed: string) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("The dog barks");
  }
}

let dog1: Dog = new Dog("Max", "Labrador");
console.log(dog1.name); // Output: "Max"
console.log(dog1.breed); // Output: "Labrador"
dog1.makeSound(); // Output: "The
```
