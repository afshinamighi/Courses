Here's a short tutorial on using TypeScript for a simple program in a web browser:

Step 1: Set up your development environment
Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the 
official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

Step 2: Create a new project
Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt. Then, initialize a new npm project by running the 
following command:

```csharp
npm init -y
```

Step 3: Install TypeScript
Next, install TypeScript as a development dependency in your project by running the following command:

```css
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

Step 4: Create a TypeScript file
Create a new file in your project folder with a .ts extension (e.g., app.ts). This file will contain your TypeScript code. Open the file in a text 
editor of your choice.

Step 5: Write TypeScript code
In the app.ts file, you can start writing your TypeScript code. For example, let's create a simple program that outputs a greeting message to the web 
browser console:

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet("World");
```

Step 6: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
To compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```css
npx tsc app.ts
```

This will generate a JavaScript file (app.js) based on your TypeScript code.

Step 7: Create an HTML file
Create an HTML file in the same project folder (e.g., index.html) and open it in a text editor. Add the following code to create a basic web page 
structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>TypeScript Web App</title>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>TypeScript Web App</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Step 8: Run the program
To run the program, open the index.html file in a web browser. Open the developer console (usually accessible through the browser's developer tools) 
to see the greeting message printed in the console.

That's it! You have successfully created a simple TypeScript program and run it in a web browser. You can continue writing more complex code in 
TypeScript and take advantage of its static typing and additional features to enhance your web applications. Remember to recompile your TypeScript 
code whenever you make changes to it.
