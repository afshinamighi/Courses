## TS Programs with Styles

In this tutorial, we will explore the roles of HTML, CSS, and TypeScript in creating a user-friendly web application that allows users to input text, process it, and display the results.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structural foundation of the web page, defining the layout and elements such as input boxes and buttons. It enables us to create a structured user interface that forms the backbone of our application.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to enhance the visual presentation and styling of our web app. By applying CSS rules and properties, we can customize the appearance of elements, control their positioning, and create an appealing and user-friendly interface.

TypeScript brings additional power and maintainability to our project. With its static typing and modern programming features, TypeScript helps us write more reliable and manageable code. It facilitates easier error detection, enhances code organization, and improves collaboration within development teams.

By combining these technologies, we can create an interactive web application that empowers users to enter text, trigger processing actions, and visualize the output. So, let's dive into the tutorial and learn how to leverage the capabilities of TypeScript, HTML, and CSS to build a Text Processing Web App!

### Step 1: Create the HTML file

Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and open it in a text editor. Add the following code to create the basic structure:


``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>TypeScript Text Processor</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="input-container">
      <textarea id="inputText" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>
    </div>
    <button id="processButton">Process</button>
    <div class="output-container">
      <span id="outputText"></span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Explanation:

The HTML file now includes a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section that references the CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling the elements. The structure and elements remain the same as in the previous tutorial.

### Step 2: Create the CSS file

Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and open it in a text editor. Add the following code to define the styles:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  margin-top: 100px;
}

.input-container {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.output-container {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Explanation:

The CSS code defines the styles for the respective HTML elements. The `.container` class styles the main container of the page, positioning its contents in a column layout and centering them vertically with 
align-items: `center`.
The `.input-container` class adds some bottom margin to create space below the input box.
The `.output-container` class applies a bold font weight to the output text.

### Step 3: Write TypeScript code

Create a TypeScript file (e.g., `app.ts`) and open it in a text editor. Add the following code to handle the input processing and display the result:

```typescript
function processInput() {
  const inputElement = document.getElementById("inputText") as HTMLTextAreaElement;
  const outputElement = document.getElementById("outputText") as HTMLSpanElement;
  const inputText = inputElement.value;
  const processedText = inputText.toUpperCase(); // Example processing, modify as needed
  outputElement.textContent = processedText;
}

const processButton = document.getElementById("processButton");
processButton.addEventListener("click", processInput);
```

Explanation:

The TypeScript code remains the same as in the previous tutorial. It handles the processing of the input text and updates the output text accordingly.

### Step 4: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder and run the following command to compile the TypeScript code:

```csgarp
npx tsc app.ts
```

This will generate a JavaScript file (`app.js`) based on your TypeScript code.

### Step 5: Run the program

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You should see an editor box where you can enter text, a "Process" button, and a read-only box for 
displaying the processed result. Enter some text in the editor box and click the "Process" button. The processed result, in this case, the input text 
converted to uppercase, should appear in the read-only box below.
