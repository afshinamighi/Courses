# Guideline for Designing Lessons Using Schemas and Reinforcement Learning

## Background: What You Need to Know

Before designing your lesson, it helps to understand two key ideas from psychology and learning science:

### 1. **Schemas**  
A schema is like a mental script or template that people use to understand the world.  
*Example*: When you enter a restaurant, you don’t need instructions. You just “know” what usually happens — that’s your **restaurant schema**.

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
This is how humans (and machines) learn from feedback.  
*Example*: If you try something and it goes wrong, you adjust. If it works, you do it again. That’s RL in action.

Researchers have found that **learning is stronger when we:**
- **Make predictions and get feedback** (*prediction error*),
- **Organize information into steps or modules** (like folders or checklists),
- **Simplify complex information into what’s most useful** (focusing only on what matters).

This guide shows you how to use these ideas to design **better, more engaging lessons** on any topic — especially technical or skill-based subjects like programming.

## A Framework for Designing a (short) Lesson

Use the steps below to plan your lesson. Each includes:
- What it means,
- Why it matters,
- What you can do as a teacher or lesson designer.

### 1. Activate Existing Knowledge (Schema Activation)

** What**: Start by connecting the new topic to something students already know or experience.  
** Why**: Helps students “plug in” new knowledge to an existing schema.  
** Example**:  
Teaching lists in Python? Start with:  
*“Have you ever made a shopping list or playlist?”*

### 2. Create Moments of Surprise (Prediction Error)

** What**: Let students guess what will happen, then show them the actual result.  
** Why**: Surprise grabs attention and strengthens memory.  
** Example**:  
Show this code and ask what it does:  

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[3])
```
