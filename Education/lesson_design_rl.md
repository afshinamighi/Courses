# Guideline for Designing Lessons Using Schemas and Reinforcement Learning

## Background: What You Need to Know

Before designing your lesson, it helps to understand two key ideas from psychology and learning science:

### 1. **Schemas**  
A schema is like a mental script or template that people use to understand the world.  
*Example*: When you enter a restaurant, you don’t need instructions. You just “know” what usually happens — that’s your **restaurant schema**.

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
This is how humans (and machines) learn from feedback.  
*Example*: If you try something and it goes wrong, you adjust. If it works, you do it again. That’s RL in action.

Researchers have found that **learning is stronger when we:**
- **Make predictions and get feedback** (*prediction error*),
- **Organize information into steps or modules** (like folders or checklists),
- **Simplify complex information into what’s most useful** (focusing only on what matters).

This guide shows you how to use these ideas to design **better, more engaging lessons** on any topic — especially technical or skill-based subjects like programming.

## A Framework for Designing a (short) Lesson

Use the steps below to plan your lesson. Each includes:
- What it means,
- Why it matters,
- What you can do as a teacher or lesson designer.

### 1. Activate Existing Knowledge (Schema Activation)

**What**: Start by connecting the new topic to something students already know or experience.  
**Why**: Helps students “plug in” new knowledge to an existing schema.  
**Example**: Teaching lists in Python? Start with:  *“Have you ever made a shopping list or playlist?”*

### 2. Create Moments of Surprise (Prediction Error)

**What**: Let students guess what will happen, then show them the actual result.  
**Why**: Surprise grabs attention and strengthens memory.  
**Example**: Show this code and ask what it does:  

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[3])
```

Then run it to reveal the IndexError.

### 3. Break Content into Modules (Hierarchical Structure)

**What**: Organize the topic into logical steps or “mini-schemas.”
**Why**: Easier to learn and reuse knowledge in new contexts.
**Example** (for Python lists):

1.	Create a list
2.	Access items
3.	Modify items
4.	Loop through a list

### 4. Use Goal-Oriented Activities (Model-Based Practice)

**What**: Give students clear, purposeful tasks.
**Why**: Encourages schema use and real-world thinking.
**Example**: “Create a list of your 3 favorite movies and print each one with its rank.”

### 5. Encourage Abstraction (Dimensionality Reduction)

**What**: Help students see patterns, similarities, or simplifications.
**Why**: Strengthens the core schema and helps with transfer.
**Example**: Ask: “How are lists similar to strings? What’s different?”

### 6. Use Visuals or Metaphors (Schema Anchoring)

**What**: Link ideas to images, stories, or metaphors.
**Why**: Helps students create memorable shortcuts.
**Example**: A list is like a train — each car is an item, and each one has a number (index).

### 7. Review with Feedback (Schema Consolidation)

**What**: Wrap up with a summary or quick check-in.
**Why**: Strengthens schema and clears up confusion.
**Example**: Use a quiz, discussion, or group activity to reinforce learning.

### Final Checklist for Your Lesson Design

- Did you connect to something familiar at the start?
- Did you include a moment of surprise or error?
- Did you break it into steps or logical units?
- Did students complete a goal-based task?
- Did you help them see patterns or simplify the concept?
- Did you use a visual or metaphor?
- Did you include a wrap-up with feedback?
