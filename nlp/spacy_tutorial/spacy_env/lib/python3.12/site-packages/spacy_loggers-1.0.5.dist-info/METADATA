# spacy-loggers: Logging utilities for spaCy

[![PyPi Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/spacy-loggers.svg?style=flat-square&logo=pypi&logoColor=white)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spacy-loggers)

Starting with spaCy v3.2, alternate loggers are moved into a separate package
so that they can be added and updated independently from the core spaCy
library.

`spacy-loggers` currently provides loggers for:

- [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com)
- [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/)
- [ClearML](https://www.clear.ml/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy)

`spacy-loggers` also provides additional utility loggers to facilitate interoperation
between individual loggers.

If you'd like to add a new logger or logging option, please submit a PR to this
repo!

## Setup and installation

`spacy-loggers` should be installed automatically with spaCy v3.2+, so you
usually don't need to install it separately. You can install it with `pip` or
from the conda channel `conda-forge`:

```bash
pip install spacy-loggers
```

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge spacy-loggers
```

# Loggers

## WandbLogger

### Installation

This logger requires `wandb` to be installed and configured:

```bash
pip install wandb
wandb login
```

### Usage

`spacy.WandbLogger.v5` is a logger that sends the results of each training step
to the dashboard of the [Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) tool. To use
this logger, Weights & Biases should be installed, and you should be logged in.
The logger will send the full config file to W&B, as well as various system
information such as memory utilization, network traffic, disk IO, GPU
statistics, etc. This will also include information such as your hostname and
operating system, as well as the location of your Python executable.

`spacy.WandbLogger.v4` and below automatically call the [default console logger](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#ConsoleLogger).
However, starting with `spacy.WandbLogger.v5`, console logging must be activated
through the use of the [ChainLogger](#chainlogger). This allows the user to configure
the console logger's parameters according to their preferences.

**Note** that by default, the full (interpolated)
[training config](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) is sent over to the
W&B dashboard. If you prefer to **exclude certain information** such as path
names, you can list those fields in "dot notation" in the
`remove_config_values` parameter. These fields will then be removed from the
config before uploading, but will otherwise remain in the config file stored
on your local system.

### Example config

```ini
[training.logger]
@loggers = "spacy.WandbLogger.v5"
project_name = "monitor_spacy_training"
remove_config_values = ["paths.train", "paths.dev", "corpora.train.path", "corpora.dev.path"]
log_dataset_dir = "corpus"
model_log_interval = 1000
```

## MLflowLogger

### Installation

This logger requires `mlflow` to be installed and configured:

```bash
pip install mlflow
```

### Usage

`spacy.MLflowLogger.v2` is a logger that tracks the results of each training step
using the [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/) tool. To use
this logger, MLflow should be installed. At the beginning of each model training
operation, the logger will initialize a new MLflow run and set it as the active
run under which metrics and parameters wil be logged. The logger will then log
the entire config file as parameters of the active run. After each training step,
the following actions are performed:

- The final score is logged under the metric `score`.
- Individual component scores are logged under their default names.
- Loss values of different components are logged with the `loss_` prefix.
- If the final score is higher than the previous best score (for the current run),
  the model artifact is additionally uploaded to MLflow. This action is only performed
  if the `output_path` argument is provided during the training pipeline initialization phase.

By default, the tracking API writes data into files in a local `./mlruns` directory.

`spacy.MLflowLogger.v1` and below automatically call the [default console logger](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#ConsoleLogger).
However, starting with `spacy.MLflowLogger.v2`, console logging must be activated
through the use of the [ChainLogger](#chainlogger). This allows the user to configure
the console logger's parameters according to their preferences.

**Note** that by default, the full (interpolated)
[training config](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) is sent over to
MLflow. If you prefer to **exclude certain information** such as path
names, you can list those fields in "dot notation" in the
`remove_config_values` parameter. These fields will then be removed from the
config before uploading, but will otherwise remain in the config file stored
on your local system.

### Example config

```ini
[training.logger]
@loggers = "spacy.MLflowLogger.v2"
experiment_id = "1"
run_name = "with_fast_alignments"
nested = False
remove_config_values = ["paths.train", "paths.dev", "corpora.train.path", "corpora.dev.path"]
```

| `nested`               | `bool`                     | Controls whether run is nested in parent run. `True` creates a nested run (default: `False`).                                                                                                                                     |
| `tags`                 | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary of string keys and values to set as tags on the run. If a run is being resumed, these tags are set on the resumed run. If a new run is being created, these tags are set on the new run (default: `None`).           |
| `remove_config_values` | `List[str]`                | A list of values to exclude from the config before it is uploaded to MLflow (default: `[]`).                                                                                                                                      |

## ClearMLLogger

### Installation

This logger requires `clearml` to be installed and configured:

```bash
pip install clearml
clearml-init
```

### Usage

`spacy.ClearMLLogger.v2` is a logger that tracks the results of each training step
using the [ClearML](https://www.clear.ml/) tool. To use
this logger, ClearML should be installed and you should have initialized (using the command above).
The logger will send all the gathered information to your ClearML server, either [the hosted free tier](https://app.clear.ml)
or the open source [self-hosted server](https://github.com/allegroai/clearml-server). This logger captures the following information, all of which is visible in the ClearML web UI:

- The full spaCy config file contents.
- Code information such as git repository, commit ID and uncommitted changes.
- Full console output.
- Miscellaneous info such as time, python version and hardware information.
- Output scalars:
  - The final score is logged under the scalar `score`.
  - Individual component scores are grouped together on one scalar plot (filterable using the web UI).
  - Loss values of different components are logged with the `loss_` prefix.

In addition to the above, the following artifacts can also be optionally captured:

- Best model directory (zipped).
- Latest model directory (zipped).
- Dataset used to train.
  - Versioned using ClearML Data and linked to under Configuration -> User Properties on the web UI.

`spacy.ClearMLLogger.v1` and below automatically call the [default console logger](https://spacy.io/api/top-level#ConsoleLogger).
However, starting with `spacy.ClearMLLogger.v2`, console logging must be activated
through the use of the [ChainLogger](#chainlogger). This allows the user to configure
the console logger's parameters according to their preferences.

**Note** that by default, the full (interpolated)
[training config](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) is sent over to
ClearML. If you prefer to **exclude certain information** such as path
names, you can list those fields in "dot notation" in the
`remove_config_values` parameter. These fields will then be removed from the
config before uploading, but will otherwise remain in the config file stored
on your local system.

### Example config

```ini
[training.logger]
@loggers = "spacy.ClearMLLogger.v2"
project_name = "Hello ClearML!"
task_name = "My spaCy Task"
model_log_interval = 1000
log_best_dir = training/model-best
log_latest_dir = training/model-last
log_dataset_dir = corpus
remove_config_values = ["paths.train", "paths.dev", "corpora.train.path", "corpora.dev.path"]
```

## PyTorchLogger

### Installation

This logger requires `torch` to be installed:

```bash
pip install torch
```

### Usage

`spacy.PyTorchLogger.v1` is different from the other loggers above in that it does not act as a bridge between spaCy and
an external framework. Instead, it is used to query PyTorch-specific metrics and make them available to other loggers.
Therefore, it's primarily intended to be used with [ChainLogger](#chainlogger).

Whenever a logging checkpoint is reached, it queries statistics from the PyTorch backend and stores them in
the dictionary passed to it. Downstream loggers can thereafter lookup the statistics and log them to their
preferred framework.

The following PyTorch statistics are currently supported:

- [CUDA memory statistics](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.cuda.memory_stats.html#torch.cuda.memory_stats)

### Example config

```ini
[training.logger]
@loggers = "spacy.ChainLogger.v1"
logger1 = {"@loggers": "spacy.PyTorchLogger.v1", "prefix": "pytorch", "device": "0", "cuda_mem_metric": "current"}
# Alternatively, you can use any other logger that provides the `log_custom_stats` parameter.
logger2 = {"@loggers": "spacy.LookupLogger.v1", "patterns": ["pytorch"]}
```

| Name              | Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix`          | `str` | All metric names are prefixed with this string using dot notation, e.g: `<prefix>.<metric>` (default: `pytorch`).                                               |
| `device`          | `int` | The identifier of the CUDA device (default: `0`).                                                                                                               |
| `cuda_mem_pool`   | `str` | One of the memory pool values specified in the PyTorch docs: `all`, `large_pool`, `small_pool` (default: `all`).                                                |
| `cuda_mem_metric` | `str` | One of the memory metric values specified in the PyTorch docs: `current`, `peak`, `allocated`, `freed`. To log all metrics, use `all` instead (default: `all`). |

## CupyLogger

### Installation

This logger requires `cupy` to be installed:

```bash
pip install cupy
```

### Usage

Similar to `PyTorchLogger`, `spacy.CupyLogger.v1` does not act as a bridge between spaCy and an external framework
but rather is used with the [ChainLogger](#chainlogger) to facilitate the flow of metrics to other loggers.
The `CupyLogger` queries statistics from the CuPy backend and stores them in the info dictionary passed to it. Downstream
loggers can thereafter lookup the statistics and log them to their preferred framework.

The following CuPy statistics are currently supported:

- [CUDA memory pool statistics](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/user_guide/memory.html)

### Example config

```ini
[training.logger]
@loggers = "spacy.ChainLogger.v1"
logger1 = {"@loggers": "spacy.CupyLogger.v1", "prefix": "cupy"}
# Alternatively, you can use any other logger that provides the `log_custom_stats` parameter.
logger2 = {"@loggers": "spacy.LookupLogger.v1", "patterns": ["cupy"]}
```

| Name     | Type  | Description                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix` | `str` | All metric names are prefixed with this string using dot notation, e.g: `<prefix>.<metric>` (default: `"cupy"`). |

# Utility Loggers

## ChainLogger

### Usage

This logger can be used to daisy-chain multiple loggers and execute them in-order. Loggers that are executed earlier in the chain
can pass information to those that come later by adding it to the dictionary that is passed to them.

Currently, up to 10 loggers can be chained together.

### Example config

```ini
[training.logger]
@loggers = "spacy.ChainLogger.v1"
logger1 = {"@loggers": "spacy.PyTorchLogger.v1"}

## LookupLogger

### Usage

This logger can be used to lookup statistics in the info dictionary and print them to `stdout`. It is primarily
intended to be used as a tool when developing new loggers.

### Example config

```ini
[training.logger]
@loggers = "spacy.ChainLogger.v1"
logger1 = {"@loggers": "spacy.PyTorchLogger.v1", "prefix": "pytorch"}
logger2 = {"@loggers": "spacy.LookupLogger.v1", "patterns": ["^[pP]ytorch"]}
```

| Name       | Type        | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `patterns` | `List[str]` | A list of regular expressions. If a statistic's name matches one of these, it's printed to `stdout`. |
