<h2 align="center">A Quick Introduction for Programmers</h2>

In this brief introductory course, a collection of self-contained learning materials has been prepared to facilitate the learning and practice of the fundamental concepts of quantum computing. This collection is designed for individuals interested in beginning quantum programming with minimal theoretical prerequisites.
