# Quantum Computing 
## A Quick Introduction for Programmers

</div>

In this very short introductory course, I try to prepare a collection of self-standing learning material to learn and practice very basics of quantum computing.
This collection is prepared for those who are interested in starting quantum programming with a minimum requirement of theory.
