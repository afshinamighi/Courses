# We Need a New Language

We have been used to program in classical computers. Classical Computers with encoding information in a sequence of bits, i.e. 0s and 1s. 
Now we are about to shift towards Quantum Computers. Discussions in quantum world using classical language and explanation will be difficult. We need a new way of looking at the computing and new language to express.

In this text we try to stay away from physical propertries of all the hardware and circuits. Instead, we are interested to employ our experience and knowledge from classical computing.

Let's start from the very fundamental definition: what is computing? Here we stick to the very basic definition: calculating. Therefore, we are going to *calculate*. In calculation (computation) we have some operands and some operators. For example, 3 + 5 is an addition of two numbers. We can express this differently: it is the application of addition operator on two operands: 3 and 5 here.

Computation usually involves more complex calculation that just simple addition. An important feature of computation is **building** complex operators using basic operators. As an example, 4 * 5 may have been considered as a separate operand but it is basically constructed using addition: `5+5+5+5`. Therefore, in order to compute complex problems we need to **learn** constructing operators using very fundamental operators. However, to make the life easier, we need to give new constructted operators new names, new symbols and precise semantics.

Nowadays we are all used to program in higher level languages: C, Python, Java, etc. We hardy think about the basics. It is mainly because there is a long history in development of classical computers and higher layers in abstracting details. But, in order to move towards quantum computing, we need to refresh our knowledge and understanding of classical computers.


This is just a test for writing matrix:

$$
\[
  A_{2\times2} =
  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
    a_{11} & a_{12} \\
    a_{21} & a_{22} \\
  \end{array} } \right]
\]
$$
