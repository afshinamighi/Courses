    "In this short manuscript basic concepts of one quantum bit is collected. The main goal is to summarize the main points in a simple way. This is not a self-content study material, but can be used as a review or quick introduction. This collection tries to keep a simple language and employs classical bits and information as a reference point of view."

    "### Probabilistic states\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coin: \n",
    "Let's assume that tossing a coin is a probabilistic operation that generates a random state. When we decide to measure the coin, the state that we read is either (T)ail or (H)ead. We denote the possible measurable states of a coin as $\\{H,T\\}$. We can these measurable states as the basis states of a coin. We know how to express the basis states of the coin after the measurement, but how can we express the state of the coin before the measurement (we mean while it is rotating in the space)? Imagine after tossing our coin we take a snapshot of the coin while it is rotating in the air. The state of the coin specifies a *probabistic state*. For example, if the angle of the coin whitin the space is in such a situation that if we instantly decide to measure with the probability of 0.75 we can read $H$ then we can express the state of the coin with a linear combination of its basis states ($H$ and $T$), like: $0.75 H + 0.25 T$. Certainly if we measure the state, the state $0.75 H + 0.25 T$ will be collapsed into one of the values $\\{H,T\\}$. How can we define such a probabilistic state in a combined structure? We can try with a tuple $( , )$ and we can make a convention that the first element specifies the probability of $H$ and the second element specifies the probability of $T$. Therefore, for our example, we can write $(0.75,025)$ as the state of the coin in our snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dice:\n",
    "Imagine a six-sided dice. Similar to coins, we let's try to model the find a formal way of specifying the probabilistic state of the dice. Throwing a dice is a probabilistic operation that starting with any state, generates one of the values $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Similar to measuring the coin, the final value of throwing the dice is the result of our measurement. If we take a snapshot of the dice, we can define its state as a probabilistic state, like: $s_d=0.12\\mathit{1}+0.08\\mathit{2}+0.24\\mathit{3}+0.31\\mathit{4}+0.11\\mathit{5}+0.14\\mathit{6}$. We have to note here that $\\mathit{1}, \\mathit{2}, \\mathit{3}, \\mathit{4}, \\mathit{5}, \\mathit{6}$ are representing the basis states of the dice, i.e. the numbers carved on the sides of the dice. Therefore, in our expression $0.12\\mathit{1}$ simply means that if measure the dice (if we stop it from spinning and rotating) with the probability of $0.12$ its state will be $\\mathit{1}$. Using notations and formalisation from probability theory this is written as $P(d=\\mathit{1})=0.12$. Let's use our style and structure from previous discussion about the coin and use one collective structre to define such a probabilistic state: $d_s = (0.12, 0.08, 0.24, 0.31, 0.11, 0.14)$. Again similar to coins, we need to make a convention that the the first element (from the left) of $(.,.,.,.,.,.)$ shows the probability of measuring the dice with the state $\\mathit{1}$, the second element from the left shows the probability of measuring the dice with the state $\\mathit{2}$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we could manage to define the probabistic states of a coin and a dice using tuples. As a general definition, $(p_H,p_T)$ denotes the probabilistic state of a coin and $(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5,p_6)$ specifies the probabilistic state of a dice. \n",
    "One the major challenges in defining a computational system is to construct an abstract system where one can define states of an object and operations on the states. A formal abstract definition provides a powerful tool to express the computations using sound and precise algorithms.\n",
    "We have already taken on step and defined the probabilistic states using tuples. But, if we need to develop further tuples might not be very suitable staructures as we would need to re-define all the operations and compositions of the states. \n",
    "If we can find an already existing formal structures then we can take advantage of already existing rules and formalism of the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are one of thise powerful mathematucal objects that has been used here. We will see later, how properties of vectors and operations on vectors will play a crucial role in defining our basic algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic state: Coin** Tossing a coin, the probabistic state of the coin can be dfined as $\\begin{bmatrix} p_H \\\\ p_T \\end{bmatrix}$. In order to get rid of $H$ and $T$ we need to take another step of our generalisation and say the coin is a system with basis states $0$ and $1$. Now it is up to the reader to think of $H$ as either values of $0$ or $1$. \n",
    "We need also to change our definition of positions within a tuple and say that the first element from the left within $(.,.)$ has position $0$ and the second element has position $1$. \n",
    "Then, within a tuple the position of the value $1$ can specify the basis state of a coin. So $(1,0)$ means that the coin is within the state $0$ and $(0,1)$ means that the coin is within the state $1$.\n",
    "Let's use our new choice which was vectors. The state $0$ can be specified as $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and the state $1$ can be specified as $1$.\n",
    "We need to review again what we have established. In our coin case, what does $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ mean? If we still follow our convention and think of the first element as $H$, then $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ means that the coin with probabilit $1$ is in the state $0$ (or $H$ according to our convention) and with the probability $0$ is in the state of $1$ (or $T$ according to our convention).\n",
    "Then what does $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix}$ mean? It simply means the coin is in the state $0$ with the probability of $0.75$ and in the state of $1$ with the probability of $0.25$. This means if we measure the state of the coin at the time of taking our snapshot, we will read one of the values $H$ and $T$ with the coresponding probabilities (feel free to make your convention here).\n",
    "Operations and rules of vectors allows us to re-write the probabilistic state of a coin based on its basis states. For example, we can write: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix} = 0.75 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + 0.25 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. It is time now to define a general definition here: if we need to specify that the coin is in the state of $0$ with probability $a$ and in the state of $1$ with probability $b$, we can write $a \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + b \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. We must not forget that the values of $a$ and $b$ must obey the rule $a+b=1$ (why?).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probabilistic state: Dice**We follow the same reasoning and discussion from formalising probabilistic state of the coin and try to define a genetal probabilistic state of a dice. If we convert tuple notations into vectors, the vector $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ means the dice is in the state $\\mathit{1}$ with the probability $1$, the vector $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ means the dice is in the state $\\mathit{2}$ with the probability $1$. The vecotr $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ 0.08 \\\\ 0.24 \\\\ 0.31 \\\\ 0.11 \\\\ 0.14 \\end{bmatrix}$ means the dice will be in the $\\mathit{1}$ with the probability $0.12$, and $P(d=\\mathit{2})=0.08$ , $P(d=\\mathit{3})=0.24$, ... . Finally, a general probabilistic state of a dice can be expressed as \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$p_1 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_2 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_3 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_4 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_5 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_6 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",

    "##### State:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have slowly built an abstract definition for probabilistic states of a a coin and a dice. But, coins and dice are just two samples here. One can imagine any example with the similar states and behaviour. In fact that the main reason we generalised our definition and encoded the states with $0$ and $1$. In this way we can use our definitions and algorithms using any physical system that fits within our expected behaviour. From now on, we just continue our discussion using generalised and abstracted states $0$ and $1$. Objects with more than two states (like dice) are not anymore of our interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an object with a probabistic behaviour and two basis states $0$ and $1$. We have learned that $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $0$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $1$. We are interested to simplify our notations and instead of $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ use a packed notation. Physisits developing quantum mechanics made conventions to use $\\ket{.}$ which is named *Dirac* notation (also known as *ket*). So we can simply replace $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{0}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our life became much easier. $\\ket{0}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $0$ and $\\ket{1}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $1$. Again, you can imagine any real world concrete object with two basis states with your own convention about $0$ and $1$. Using the new notation we can re-write our general definition for a probabilistic state $s$ as $\\ket{s} = a \\ket{0} + b \\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> **Question** Think about our coin. What does $\\ket{s} = 0.5 \\ket{0} + 0.5 \\ket{1}$ mean?\n",
    "<br> **Question** Think about our coin. Is this a valid state: $\\ket{s} = 0.2 \\ket{0} + 0.6 \\ket{1}$ ?\n",
    "<br> **Question** Think about our coin. The coin is in a stable state $\\ket{0}. We flip the coin. What is the new state?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation occurs due to operations. Applying an operation on a specific state, transforms the system into a new state which is the result of the operation. Imagine a probabilistic system with two basis states. We would like to define and formalize an operation. One very simple operation would be a reset operation. Here we define our reset operation to take the object in any of its basis states and transform it into $\\ket{0}$. In our coin example, this would mean, one picks up the coin (it can stand in one of the $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ positions) and puts it back such that its position is always $\\ket{0}$.\n",

    "| $\\ket{1}$ | $\\ket{0}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly we can define a FLIP operation. We explain our FLIP operation to take the object in any of its basis states and transform it into the other basis state. In our coin example, this would mean, one picks up the coin, flips the coin and puts it back. \n",
