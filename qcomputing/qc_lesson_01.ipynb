    "## Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start from the very fundamental definition: what is computing? Here we start with a very basic definition: calculating. Therefore, we are going to *calculate*. In calculation (computation) we have some operands and some operators. For example, 3 + 5 is an addition of two numbers. We can express this differently: it is the application of addition operator on two operands: 3 and 5 here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation usually can handle more complex calculation that just simple addition. An important feature of computation is **building** complex operators using basic operators. As an example, 4 * 5 may have been considered as a separate operand but it is basically constructed using addition: 5+5+5+5. Therefore, in order to compute complex problems we need to **learn** constructing operators using very fundamental operators. However, to make the life easier, we need to give new constructted operators new names, new symbols and precise semantics.\n",
    "Solving computational problems one need to designe a **right** composition of operations to solve the problem. If the same set of operations are composed differently, may provide an answer for a different problem. Learning any computational language it is very crucial to practice with the operations and then see how the compositions of them can help us solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays we are all used to program in higher level languages: C, Python, Java, etc. We hardy think about the basics. It is mainly because there is a long history in development of classical computers and higher layers in abstracting details. But, in order to move towards quantum computing, we need to refresh our knowledge and understanding of classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we start with only one bit in classical computers and then we gradually try to introduce the quantum bit. While explaining basics of the bits, we try to touch elementary operations. To follow the construction of bits and computations in classical computers one need to understand the langauge of boolean algebra. In quantum computing one needs to have a robust foundation in linear algebra, otherwise applications of operations would not make sense.\n"

    "### Deterministic States\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum information is an extension of classical information. To comprehend and explore quantum information, a solid foundation in classical information is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cbit\n",
    "Classical information is represented by classical bits (cbit). A cbit can be decoded using only two states: 0 and 1. Essentially, one cbit can represent two states. For instance, when tossing a coin, the outcome (head or tail) can be encoded with one cbit. To encode more information, additional bits are required. A switch with four states (On, Off, Dimmed, Flashing) can be represented by two cbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a given deterministic system, any operation on one or more cbits can change the state, transforming the system deterministically into a new state. A light with only two states can be defined as a deterministic system. Toggling the light switch is an operation that negates the current state of the light, turning it On (1) if it is Off (0). However, tossing a coin does not necessarily negate the current state of the coin. It can be considered as a probabilistic system if we lack knowledge about the physical properties of the coin and the tossing operation (e.g., force and angle of tossing). Here, first, we focus on a deterministic system.\n",

    "### Probabilistic states\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coin: \n",
    "Let's assume that tossing a coin is a probabilistic operation that generates a random state. When we decide to measure the coin, the state that we read is either (T)ail or (H)ead. This means that measuring the state of the coin, collapses the state of the coin into one of its classical states. We denote the possible measurable classical states of a coin as $\\{H,T\\}$. These measurable classical state are names as the basis states of a coin. We know how to express the basis states of the coin after the measurement, but how can we express the state of the coin before the measurement (we mean while it is rotating in the space)? Imagine after tossing our coin we take a snapshot of the coin while it is rotating in the air. The state of the coin specifies a *probabistic state*. For example, if the angle of the coin whitin the space is in such a situation that if we instantly decide to measure with the probability of 0.75 we can read $H$ then we can express the state of the coin with a linear combination of its basis states ($H$ and $T$), like: $0.75 H + 0.25 T$. Certainly if we measure the state, the state $0.75 H + 0.25 T$ will be collapsed into one of the values $\\{H,T\\}$. How can we define such a probabilistic state in a combined structure? We can try with a tuple $( , )$ and we can make a convention that the first element specifies the probability of $H$ and the second element specifies the probability of $T$. Therefore, for our example, we can write $(0.75,025)$ as the state of the coin in our snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dice:\n",
    "Imagine a six-sided dice. Similar to coins, we try to model and find a formal way of specifying the probabilistic state of the dice. Throwing a dice is a probabilistic operation that starting with any state, generates one of the values $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Similar to measuring the coin, the final value of throwing the dice is the result of our measurement. If we take a snapshot of the dice, we can define its state as a probabilistic state, like: $s_d=0.12\\mathit{1}+0.08\\mathit{2}+0.24\\mathit{3}+0.31\\mathit{4}+0.11\\mathit{5}+0.14\\mathit{6}$. We have to note here that $\\mathit{1}, \\mathit{2}, \\mathit{3}, \\mathit{4}, \\mathit{5}, \\mathit{6}$ are representing the basis states of the dice, i.e. the numbers carved on the sides of the dice. Therefore, in our expression $0.12\\mathit{1}$ simply means that if measure the dice (if we stop it from spinning and rotating) with the probability of $0.12$ its state will be $\\mathit{1}$. Using notations and formalisation from probability theory this is written as $P(d=\\mathit{1})=0.12$. Let's use our style and structure from previous discussion about the coin and use one collective structure to define such a probabilistic state: $d_s = (0.12, 0.08, 0.24, 0.31, 0.11, 0.14)$. Again similar to coins, we need to make a convention that the the first element (from the left) of $(.,.,.,.,.,.)$ shows the probability of measuring the dice with the state $\\mathit{1}$, the second element from the left shows the probability of measuring the dice with the state $\\mathit{2}$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we could manage to define the probabilistic states of a coin and a dice using tuples. As a general definition, $(p_H,p_T)$ denotes the probabilistic state of a coin and $(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4,p_5,p_6)$ specifies the probabilistic state of a dice. \n",
    "One of the major challenges in defining a computational system is to construct an abstract system where one can define states of an object and operations on the states. A formal abstract definition provides a powerful tool to express the computations using sound and precise algorithms.\n",
    "We have already taken one step in defining the probabilistic states using tuples. But, if we need to develop further tuples might not be very suitable structures as we would need to re-define all the operations and compositions of the states. \n",
    "If we can find an already existing formal structures then we can take advantage of already existing rules and formalism of the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are one of the powerful mathematical objects that has been used here. We will see later, how properties of vectors and operations on vectors will play a crucial role in defining our basic algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tossing a coin, the probabilistic state of the coin can be dfined as $\\begin{bmatrix} p_H \\\\ p_T \\end{bmatrix}$. In order to get rid of $H$ and $T$ we need to take another step of our generalisation and say the coin is a system with basis states $0$ and $1$. Now it is up to the reader to think of $H$ as either values of $0$ or $1$. \n",
    "We need also to change our definition of positions within a tuple and say that the first element from the left within $(.,.)$ has position $0$ and the second element has position $1$. \n",
    "Then, within a tuple the position of the value $1$ can specify the basis state of a coin. So $(1,0)$ means that the coin is within the state $0$ and $(0,1)$ means that the coin is within the state $1$.\n",
    "Let's use our new choice which was vectors. The state $0$ can be specified as $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and the state $1$ can be specified as $1$.\n",
    "We need to review again what we have established. In our coin case, what does $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ mean? If we still follow our convention and think of the first element as $H$, then $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ means that the coin with probabilit $1$ is in the state $0$ (or $H$ according to our convention) and with the probability $0$ is in the state of $1$ (or $T$ according to our convention).\n",
    "Then what does $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix}$ mean? It simply means the coin is in the state $0$ with the probability of $0.75$ and in the state of $1$ with the probability of $0.25$. This means if we measure the state of the coin at the time of taking our snapshot, we will read one of the values $H$ and $T$ with the coresponding probabilities (feel free to make your convention here).\n",
    "Operations and rules of vectors allows us to re-write the probabilistic state of a coin based on its basis states. For example, we can write: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix} = 0.75 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + 0.25 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. It is time now to define a general definition here: if we need to specify that the coin is in the state of $0$ with probability $a$ and in the state of $1$ with probability $b$, we can write $a \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + b \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. We must not forget that the values of $a$ and $b$ must obey the rule $a+b=1$ (why?).\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the same reasoning and discussion from formalising probabilistic state of the coin and try to define a genetal probabilistic state of a dice. If we convert tuple notations into vectors, the vector $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ means the dice is in the state $\\mathit{1}$ with the probability $1$, the vector $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ means the dice is in the state $\\mathit{2}$ with the probability $1$. The vecotr $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ 0.08 \\\\ 0.24 \\\\ 0.31 \\\\ 0.11 \\\\ 0.14 \\end{bmatrix}$ means the dice will be in the $\\mathit{1}$ with the probability $0.12$, and $P(d=\\mathit{2})=0.08$ , $P(d=\\mathit{3})=0.24$, ... . Finally, a general probabilistic state of a dice can be expressed as \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$p_1 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_2 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_3 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_4 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_5 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + p_6 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",

    "#### A Probabilistic System:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### State:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have slowly built an abstract definition for probabilistic states of a a coin and a dice. But, coins and dice are just two samples here. One can imagine any example with the similar states and behaviour. In fact that the main reason we generalised our definition and encoded the states with $0$ and $1$. In this way we can use our definitions and algorithms using any physical system that fits within our expected behaviour. From now on, we just continue our discussion using generalised and abstracted states $0$ and $1$. Objects with more than two states (like dice) are not anymore of our interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an object with a probabistic behaviour and two basis states $0$ and $1$. We have learned that $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $0$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $1$. We are interested to simplify our notations and instead of $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ use a packed notation. Physisits developing quantum mechanics made conventions to use $\\ket{.}$ which is named *Dirac* notation (also known as *ket*). So we can simply replace $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{0}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our life became much easier. $\\ket{0}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $0$ and $\\ket{1}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $1$. Again, you can imagine any real world concrete object with two basis states with your own convention about $0$ and $1$. Using the new notation we can re-write our general definition for a probabilistic state $s$ as $\\ket{s} = a \\ket{0} + b \\ket{1}$.\n",

    "<br> **Question** Think about our coin. What does $\\ket{s} = 0.5 \\ket{0} + 0.5 \\ket{1}$ mean?\n",

    "<br> **Question** Think about our coin. The coin is in a stable state $\\ket{0}. We flip the coin. What is the new state?\n",

    "##### Operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation occurs due to operations. Applying an operation on a specific state, transforms the system into a new state which is the result of the operation. Imagine a probabilistic system with two basis states. We would like to define and formalize an operation. One very simple operation would be a reset operation. Here we define our reset operation to take the object in any of its basis states and transform it into $\\ket{0}$. In our coin example, this would mean, one picks up the coin (it can stand in one of the $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ positions) and puts it back such that its position is always $\\ket{0}$.\n",
