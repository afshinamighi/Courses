    "# Quantum Bit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, we have been programming on classical computers, which process information using bits—binary units that can be either 0 or 1. However, we are now transitioning into the era of quantum computing, which introduces a completely different way of encoding and manipulating information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussing quantum computing using classical terminology and explanations can be challenging. Quantum concepts often require a new way of thinking, as well as a different language to express ideas effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to provide a concise and accessible introduction to quantum computing, focusing on its fundamental principles. This is not a standalone, in-depth study guide but rather a quick review or an entry point for computer scientists who are familiar with classical computing. Throughout this tutorial, we will use classical bits and traditional computing concepts as a reference to ease the transition into quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, we will avoid discussions of the physical properties of quantum hardware and circuits. Instead, our focus will be on understanding quantum computing concepts through the lens of classical computing experience and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with a fundamental question: What is computing? At its core, computing can be simply defined as calculating. In any computation, we work with operands (the values being manipulated) and operators (the rules or functions applied to those values). For example, in the expression 3 + 5, we apply the addition operator to the operands 3 and 5 to obtain the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, computation is not limited to basic arithmetic operations like addition. A key aspect of computation is the ability to build complex operations using simpler ones. For instance, multiplication can be broken down into repeated addition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$4 \\times 5 = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to construct complex operations from fundamental ones is crucial in solving computational problems efficiently. To simplify our understanding, we assign new symbols, names, and precise semantics to these newly constructed operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composing Operations to Solve Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve a computational problem, one must design the right composition of operations. The same set of operations, when arranged differently, can solve entirely different problems. Learning any computational language requires practice with fundamental operations and an understanding of how their composition leads to meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are accustomed to programming in high-level languages such as C, Python, and Java, where many fundamental details are abstracted away. This abstraction is the result of decades of development in classical computing, allowing programmers to work efficiently without worrying about the underlying mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we transition into quantum computing, we need to refresh our understanding of classical computing fundamentals. Unlike classical programming, where most details are hidden, quantum computing requires a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations behind computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Classical Bits to Quantum Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we begin by examining a single classical bit, gradually introducing the quantum bit (qubit). While exploring the fundamentals of bits, we will also discuss elementary operations that form the basis of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the structure of classical computation, one must be familiar with Boolean algebra, which provides the logical framework for classical computing. Similarly, in quantum computing, a strong foundation in linear algebra is essential—without it, quantum operations would not be intuitive or meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "By building this foundation, we can better grasp the differences between classical and quantum computing and appreciate the power of quantum computation."

    "## State transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deterministic\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum information is an extension of classical information. To fully understand and explore quantum computing, it is crucial to first establish a strong foundation in classical information theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical computing, information is represented using classical bits (cbits). A cbit can exist in one of two possible states: 0 or 1. This means that a single cbit can represent exactly two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a coin toss—the outcome (heads or tails) can be encoded using a single cbit: Heads (0) and Tails (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent more complex information, additional bits are required. For instance, a switch with four possible states (On, Off, Dimmed, Flashing) can be represented using two cbits, which provide  $2^2 = 4$  possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deterministic system follows predictable rules: given an initial state and a set of operations, the system will always transition to a specific, well-defined new state. Any operation on one or more cbits in a deterministic system will produce a predictable outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a light switch that has only two states: On (1) and Off (0). This is a deterministic system because flipping the switch always negates the current state:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - If the light is Off (0), flipping the switch turns it On (1).\n",
    "  - If the light is On (1), flipping the switch turns it Off (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all systems behave deterministically. Consider a coin toss again—if we do not know the exact physical properties of the coin and the way it is tossed (e.g., the force, angle, and spin), we cannot deterministically predict whether the result will be heads or tails. This makes it a probabilistic system rather than a deterministic one. For now, we focus only on deterministic systems before introducing probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical computing, one of the simplest deterministic operations is the NOT gate. This operation inverts the input bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If the input is 0, the output becomes 1.\n",
    "  - If the input is 1, the output becomes 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following truth table describes this behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "input|output\n",
    "--|--\n",
    "0 | 1\n",
    "1 | 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question** Introduce another example of deterministic operator on one cbit?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabilistic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coin: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume that tossing a coin is a probabilistic operation that results in a random state. When we decide to measure the coin, the observed state is either **(H)**ead or **(T)**ail. This means that measuring the state of the coin collapses it into one of its classical states. We denote the possible measurable classical states of a coin as ${H,T}$. These measurable states are known as the *basis states* of the coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know how to express the basis states of the coin after measurement, but how can we describe the state of the coin before measurement—for instance, while it is still rotating in the air? Imagine taking a snapshot of the coin mid-flight. The state of the coin at that moment represents a probabilistic state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the angle of the coin in space is such that, upon immediate measurement, there is a 0.75 probability of reading $H$, we can express this probabilistic state as a linear combination of its basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$0.75 H + 0.25 T$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once measured, the state collapses to either $H$ or $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we formally represent such a probabilistic state? We can use a tuple representation: $(0.75, 0.25)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, by convention:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The first element represents the probability of measuring $H$.\n",
    "  - The second element represents the probability of measuring $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notation provides a structured way to describe the *uncollapsed state* of the coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dice:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s consider a six-sided fair die. Similar to the coin, we aim to formally describe its probabilistic state. \n",
    "Rolling a die is also a probabilistic operation that starts in an unknown state and results in one of six values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of rolling the die is determined at the moment of measurement (when it lands). However, before measurement, we can describe its state probabilistically.\n",
    "For example, suppose the die’s probabilistic state is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "s_d = 0.12 \\mathit{1} + 0.08 \\mathit{2} + 0.24 \\mathit{3} + 0.31 \\mathit{4} + 0.11 \\mathit{5} + 0.14 \\mathit{6}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each coefficient represents the probability of landing on a given number. Using probability notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(d = \\mathit{1}) = 0.12, \\quad P(d = \\mathit{2}) = 0.08, \\quad P(d = \\mathit{3}) = 0.24, \\quad \\dots\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the tuple structure introduced for the coin, we can also represent the probabilistic state of the die as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "d_s = (0.12, 0.08, 0.24, 0.31, 0.11, 0.14)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The first element represents the probability of measuring $1$.\n",
    "  - The second element represents the probability of measuring $2$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a structured method for defining the probabilistic state of a die.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A More Formal Representation: Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have used tuples to define the probabilistic states of a coin and a die. In computational systems, however, we seek generalized abstract representations that allow for well-defined operations and transformations. Vectors provide a powerful mathematical framework that allows us to describe states formally while leveraging existing mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of using tuples, we can represent the probabilistic state of a coin using a column vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} p_H \\\\ p_T \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize further, we replace $H$ and $T$ with the labels $0$ and $1$, treating the coin as a system with basis states ${0,1}$. Now, we define a convention:\n",
    "  - The first element corresponds to the basis state $0$.\n",
    "  - The second element corresponds to the basis state $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we represent the classical basis states as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{(state 0)}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{(state 1)}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ represents a coin in state $0$ with probability 1 (certain outcome).\n",
    "  - $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ represents a coin in state $1$ with probability 1 (certain outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this notation, the probabilistic state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "means that the coin is in state $0$ with probability 0.75 and in state $1$ with probability 0.25. If we measure the coin, we will observe either $0$ or $1$ with these probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector representation allows us to rewrite probabilistic states using basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix} = 0.75 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + 0.25 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a probabilistic state of a coin can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "a \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + b \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a + b = 1$ (since probabilities must sum to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the same reasoning, we can represent the probabilistic state of a die using vectors instead of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "means the die is in the state $1$ with probability 1. Similarly, the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "means the die is in the state $2$ with probability 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A probabilistic die state such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0.12 \\\\ 0.08 \\\\ 0.24 \\\\ 0.31 \\\\ 0.11 \\\\ 0.14 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "means:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $P(d = 1) = 0.12$\n",
    "  - $P(d = 2) = 0.08$\n",
    "  - $P(d = 3) = 0.24$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the general probabilistic state of a die can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "p_1 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} +\n",
    "p_2 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} +\n",
    "p_3 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} +\n",
    "p_4 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} +\n",
    "p_5 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} +\n",
    "p_6 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",

    "where:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{6} p_i = 1\n",
    "$\n",

    "#### A Probabilistic System:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### State:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have slowly built an abstract definition for probabilistic states of a a coin and a dice. But, coins and dice are just two samples here. One can imagine any example with the similar states and behaviour. In fact that the main reason we generalised our definition and encoded the states with $0$ and $1$. In this way we can use our definitions and algorithms using any physical system that fits within our expected behaviour. From now on, we just continue our discussion using generalised and abstracted states $0$ and $1$. Objects with more than two states (like dice) are not anymore of our interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an object with a probabistic behaviour and two basis states $0$ and $1$. We have learned that $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $0$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $1$. We are interested to simplify our notations and instead of $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ use a packed notation. Physisits developing quantum mechanics made conventions to use $\\ket{.}$ which is named *Dirac* notation (also known as *ket*). So we can simply replace $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{0}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our life became much easier. $\\ket{0}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $0$ and $\\ket{1}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $1$. Again, you can imagine any real world concrete object with two basis states with your own convention about $0$ and $1$. Using the new notation we can re-write our general definition for a probabilistic state $s$ as $\\ket{s} = a \\ket{0} + b \\ket{1}$.\n",

Imagine a probabilistic system with two basis states. We would like to define and formalize an operation. One very simple operation would be a reset operation. Here we define our reset operation to take the object in any of its basis states and transform it into $\\ket{0}$. In our coin example, this would mean, one picks up the coin (it can stand in one of the $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ positions) and puts it back such that its position is always $\\ket{0}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have slowly built an abstract definition for probabilistic states of a a coin and a dice. But, coins and dice are just two samples here. One can imagine any example with the similar states and behaviour. In fact that the main reason we generalised our definition and encoded the states with $0$ and $1$. In this way we can use our definitions and algorithms using any physical system that fits within our expected behaviour. From now on, we just continue our discussion using generalised and abstracted states $0$ and $1$. Objects with more than two states (like dice) are not anymore of our interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an object with a probabistic behaviour and two basis states $0$ and $1$. We have learned that $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $0$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ can be used to specify $1$. We are interested to simplify our notations and instead of $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ use a packed notation. Physisits developing quantum mechanics made conventions to use $\\ket{.}$ which is named *Dirac* notation (also known as *ket*). So we can simply replace $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{0}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ with $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our life became much easier. $\\ket{0}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $0$ and $\\ket{1}$ means our probabilistic object is in the state $1$. Again, you can imagine any real world concrete object with two basis states with your own convention about $0$ and $1$. Using the new notation we can re-write our general definition for a probabilistic state $s$ as $\\ket{s} = a \\ket{0} + b \\ket{1}$.\n",

    "Computation occurs due to operations. Applying an operation on a specific state, transforms the system into a new state which is the result of the operation. Imagine a probabilistic system with two basis states. We would like to define and formalize an operation. One very simple operation would be a reset operation. Here we define our reset operation to take the object in any of its basis states and transform it into $\\ket{0}$. In our coin example, this would mean, one picks up the coin (it can stand in one of the $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ positions) and puts it back such that its position is always $\\ket{0}$.\n",

    "#### QBit\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum information extends classical information primarily through the expansion of cbits. In qbit, the state zero is no longer the number 0 but a column vector: $ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $. Similarly, the state one in qbit is a column vector with the value of the second item (item with index 1) as 1, i.e., $ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the initial state of a qbit is $ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} $. Applying a NOT must transform the state of the qbit into $ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $. Let's shape a truth table for the negation on a qbit:\n",

    "\n",
    "To express the negation mathematically, we need to find a transformation that, given a state, yields the negated state. It is common to express the negation of a qbit using $X$. Therefore, we have:\n",
