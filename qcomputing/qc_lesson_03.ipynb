    "So far, we have explored the fundamental concepts of a single qubit, including superposition and basic quantum operations. We have also practiced implementing these operations using Qiskit, gaining hands-on experience in programming quantum circuits. In this tutorial, we will extend our understanding to computations involving two qubits, which introduces new and powerful quantum phenomena. Specifically, we will learn how to represent the quantum state of a two-qubit system, examine the types of operations that can be applied, and explore key concepts such as entanglement and quantum correlations [todo: maybe to skip]. Additionally, we will work with multi-qubit gates, such as the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, which enables interactions between qubits and forms the foundation of many quantum algorithms. Similar to our experience with a single qubit, we will implement simple quantum programs, analyze their results, and build an intuitive understanding of how two-qubit quantum computations work."

As we have learned, both the  X  (NOT) and  H  (Hadamard) gates are single-qubit operations, meaning they are naturally applicable to individual qubits within a multi-qubit system. However, when dealing with multi-qubit states, we need to carefully interpret notations like $ X \\ket{01} $, $ H \\ket{00} $, or $ X X \\ket{00} $.\n",

    "In multi-qubit systems, when a single-qubit gate (such as  X  or  H ) is applied to a specific qubit, the other qubits remain unchanged. The notation follows a left-to-right order, where the leftmost qubit is the most significant in the computational basis.\n",

    "But there are operations that inherently need more input bits. Similar to classical computing, the operations AND, OR, and XOR all need to have two inputs in order to operation. Do we have quAND, quOR or quXOR? As we remember from the one qubit systems, an operation in quantum computing would be defined as a valid operation if it is reversible. From the truth tables of AND and OR we rememeber that these two operations are not reversible operations. Having 0 as the result of the AND operation there is no way to find out the values of the inputs because there are three different combinations can be given as the input: 00 , 01 and 10. The same reasoning is applicable to the OR operation. \n",

    "| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n",

    "The issue here is that given only the output, we cannot uniquely determine the original inputs. For example, if the output is 1, we don’t know whether the inputs were (0,1) or (1,0). Because of this loss of information, the standard XOR operation is not reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, every valid operation must be reversible, so we use an extended version of XOR called the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation defined as follow:\n",

    "We can interpret this operation more intuitively. As explained earlier, the CNOT gate preserves the first bit ( A ) unchanged while modifying the second bit ( B ) by XOR-ing it with  A . By examining the truth table, we can see how this works:\n",
    "- If  A = 0 , the second bit ( B ) remains unchanged.\n",
    "- If  A = 1 , the second bit ( B ) is flipped.\n",
