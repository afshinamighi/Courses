    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have explored the fundamental concepts of a single qubit, including superposition and basic quantum operations. We have also practiced implementing these operations using Qiskit, gaining hands-on experience in programming quantum circuits. In this tutorial, we will extend our understanding to computations involving two qubits, which introduces new and powerful quantum phenomena. Specifically, we will learn how to represent the quantum state of a two-qubit system, examine the types of operations that can be applied, and explore key concepts such as entanglement and quantum correlations [todo: maybe to skip]. Additionally, we will work with multi-qubit gates, such as the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, which enables interactions between qubits and forms the foundation of many quantum algorithms. Similar to our experience with a single qubit, we will implement simple quantum programs, analyze their results, and build an intuitive understanding of how two-qubit quantum computations work."
