    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the basics of one-bit quantum computing, focusing on how a single quantum bit—or qubit—can be represented, manipulated, and measured. Unlike a classical bit, which is always in a definite state of either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of these two states, offering a richer mathematical structure for computation. We will approach the concept using simple mathematical abstractions, relying only on real numbers to represent qubit states, and build on familiar ideas from classical bits and probabilistic states. Our goal is to introduce the foundational elements of quantum operations and state transitions in a clear, accessible way, postponing more advanced concepts like complex vector spaces for later. By the end, you will have a basic understanding of how one-bit quantum systems behave and how they differ from their classical counterparts.\n",

    "## QBit: Definition and Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum information extends classical information primarily through the expansion of classical information. \n",
    "A quantum bit (qbit) is the basic unit of quantum information, mathematically represented as a vector in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Unlike a classical bit, which can only take values 0 or 1, a qbit can exist in a superposition of both states. A superposition represents a combination of multiple quantum states that coexist until a *measurement* is made. Mathematically, it’s a linear combination of basis states with complex probability amplitudes. The state of a qbit is typically represented using Dirac notation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\Ket{\\psi} = \\alpha \\Ket{0} + \\beta \\Ket{1}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Ket{0}$  and  $\\Ket{1}$  are the basis states (analogous to the 0 and 1 of a classical bit).\n",
    "- $\\alpha$  and  $\\beta$  are complex numbers representing probability amplitudes.\n",
    "- $|\\alpha|^2$  and  $|\\beta|^2$  are the probabilities of the qbit being in state  $\\Ket{0}$  or  $\\Ket{1}$ , respectively, with the condition that:\n",
    "$|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$ This ensures that the total probability of the qbit being in either state is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment consider $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement is one of the most fundamental ways of interacting with a quantum state and plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It can be defined as the process of extracting classical information from a quantum state, causing the quantum state to collapse into one of its possible basis states. Unlike a classical system, where the state of the system can be directly observed, a quantum state is not directly accessible or visible in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we cannot observe a probabilistic state directly but instead infer information from outcomes, we cannot directly observe a quantum state. Instead, we must perform a measurement, which transforms the abstract quantum information into a definite classical outcome. The measurement process, however, fundamentally alters the quantum state, collapsing it into one of the one of the basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, measurement is probabilistic in nature, meaning that the result of a measurement is not deterministic but rather described by probability amplitudes. The probability of obtaining a particular result is determined by the squared magnitude of the amplitude associated with that outcome. This probabilistic behavior is intrinsic to quantum systems and is not a result of experimental limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, measurement in quantum mechanics depends on the choice of the measurement basis. For example, measuring a qubit in the computational basis ( $\\Ket{0}$  or  $\\Ket{1}$ ) will yield different outcomes compared to measuring it in a different basis (e.g. the Hadamard basis). This makes measurement a much richer and more complex process than simply reading off a value from a classical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A qbit in the state  $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Ket{0} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\Ket{1}$  is in an equal superposition of 0 and 1. When measured, there is a 50% chance of observing it as 0 and a 50% chance of observing it as 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to note here that a superposition of a quantum state cannot be expressed as a purely probabilistic state. Although both concepts involve uncertainty, they are fundamentally different in nature. A probabilistic state refers to a situation where a system has a known probability of being in one of several distinct classical states. For example, a coin toss can be in state heads with 50% probability and tails with 50% probability. A quantum superposition state is not simply a probabilistic mixture of states. While the measurement outcomes can be described using classical probabilities, the underlying quantum state itself contains much richer information which have no equivalent in probabilistic states. (todo: add a link to a video where the concept can be examplied using physical features)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to our discussion on probabilistic states, we need a formal structure to define operations that transform a qubit from an initial state to a new state. Since qubits are represented using Dirac notation (vectors), we can represent these operations as matrices. Let’s begin with the standard basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following our knowledge and experience from classical bits, we can propose four possible operations on a single qubit: Identity, Not (Flip), Reset (Erase or Set to Zero), Set (Set to One).\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial requirement for qubit operations is reversibility. A reversible operation ensures that applying the operation twice restores the qubit to its initial state. For instance, the Reset operation is not reversible. If this operation is applied to $\\ket{1}$, the resulting state will be $\\ket{0}$. Applying the same operation again to $\\ket{0}$ does not bring the qubit back to its original state $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the Not operation is reversible: applying it twice returns the qubit to its initial state. Similarly, the Identity operation is also reversible, as it leaves the qubit unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we provide a formal definition of these two reversible operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not (Flip)\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, the Not operation is commonly represented by the symbol $X$. This operation is defined by the matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "X = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of $X$ on a general qubit state $\\ket{\\psi}$ can be shown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "X \\ket{\\psi} = X (\\alpha \\ket{0} + \\beta \\ket{1}) = \\alpha (X \\ket{0}) + \\beta (X \\ket{1}) = \\alpha \\ket{1} + \\beta \\ket{0} = \\beta \\ket{1} + \\alpha \\ket{0}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation effectively swaps the amplitudes of the basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$. What does this mean in practice? If we take a qubit and we try to measure it, it will colapse to $\\ket{0}$ with the probability of $\\alpha^2$. Now after applying $X$, if we measure the resulting state, it will colapse to $\\ket{0}$ with the probability of $\\beta^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** \n",
    "Use the vector representations of the basis states and the matrix representation of $X$ to prove that applying $X$ to a given qubit state switches the amplitudes of the basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** The Identity operation does not change the state of the given qubit. It is also a reversible operation. Define a matrix for $I$. Using your defined matrix check if it keeps the state of $\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha \\ket{0} + \\beta \\ket{1}$.\n",
