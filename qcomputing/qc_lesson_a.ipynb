    "# Linear Algebra: Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It provides a fundamental framework for solving systems of equations, understanding geometric transformations, and analyzing data structures in computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, linear algebra is essential because quantum states, operations, and measurements are all represented using vectors and matrices in a vector space called a Hilbert space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector is an ordered collection of numbers, usually written as a column matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can represent many things, such as:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Geometric objects (e.g., points in space, directions)\n",
    "- Data representations (e.g., RGB colors, feature vectors in machine learning)\n",
    "- Quantum states (e.g., probabilistic and superposition states)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A 2D vector in space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "    - A probabilistic state vector in quantum computing:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 0.75 \\\\ 0.25 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "(This represents a system where the first state has a 75% probability, and the second state has a 25% probability.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are used to represent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear transformations (e.g., rotations, scaling, reflections)\n",
    "- Systems of equations\n",
    "- Quantum gates (in quantum computing)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the identity matrix, which leaves any vector unchanged, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "I = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear transformation is a function that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. It can be represented using a matrix multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "A \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v{\\prime}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is a transformation matrix, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the original vector, and $\\mathbf{v’}$ is the transformed vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If we apply the matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "to the vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "A \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation scales the vector by 2 in the x-direction and 3 in the y-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner Product (Dot Product)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner product (also known as the dot product) measures similarity between two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \\dots + a_n b_n\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = (1 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 4) = 3 + 8 = 11\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is crucial in quantum mechanics, where it is used to compute probabilities of measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensor Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The tensor product (denoted as $\\otimes$) is a mathematical operation that combines two or more vectors, matrices, or spaces into a higher-dimensional space. In linear algebra, it is used to construct larger vector spaces from smaller ones, and in quantum computing, it is essential for describing multi-qubit systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, their tensor product $\\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\mathbf{b}$ produces a new vector with a higher dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two 2D vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n",
    "\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Their tensor product is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\mathbf{b} = \\\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\n",
    "\\otimes \\\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\n",
    "= \\\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 b_1 \\\\ a_1 b_2 \\\\ a_2 b_1 \\\\ a_2 b_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation creates a larger vector space that represents all possible pairwise combinations of the elements from $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s compute the tensor product of the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\times 3 \\\\ 1 \\times 4 \\\\ 2 \\times 3 \\\\ 2 \\times 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\\n",
    "= \\\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\\n",
